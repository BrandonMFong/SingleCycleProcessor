# SingleCycleProcessor
 Microprocessor

The single-cycle processor microarchitecture executes one instruction per clock cycle.  As a result, the cycle time is limited by the slowest instruction supported by the microarchitecture.

My HDL code utilizes parametric modules, such as multiplexers, program counter, adders, instruction memory, control unit, register file in the read-first mode, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), sign extension unit, and data memory. 

This design supports MIPS programming language.
